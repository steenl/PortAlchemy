# GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation Plan for PortAlchemy

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for adding automated regression testing to the PortAlchemy project using GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline will run on every pull request to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation
- [x] **Step 1.1:** Create feature branch `add-github-actions-ci` from main
- [x] **Step 1.2:** Create `scripts/` directory in project root
- [x] **Step 1.3:** Create `scripts/run_test.sh` - Main test runner script
  - Location: `/scripts/run_test.sh`
  - Purpose: Compiles and runs individual testbenches with Icarus Verilog
  - Status: ✅ Created and documented

---

### Phase 2: Core Scripts Development
- [x] **Step 2.1:** Create `scripts/parse_results.py` - Log analyzer
  - Location: `/scripts/parse_results.py`
  - Purpose: Parses simulation logs to determine pass/fail status
  - Checks for: ERROR patterns, warnings, completion status
  - Exit codes: 0 (pass) or 1 (fail)
  - Status: ✅ Created and tested

- [x] **Step 2.2:** Make scripts executable
  ```bash
  chmod +x scripts/run_test.sh
  chmod +x scripts/parse_results.py
  ```
  - Status: ✅ Complete

- [x] **Step 2.3:** Create `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` - Convenience wrapper
  - Purpose: Run all testbenches locally
  - Useful for pre-commit testing
  - Status: ✅ Created and tested

---

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions Configuration

      iverilog -v
  ```
  - Status: ✅ Configured in workflow

---

### Phase 4: Local Testing & Validation
- [x] **Step 4.1:** Test `run_test.sh` locally with one testbench
  ```bash
  cd scripts/
  ./run_test.sh ualink_turbo64_tb
  ```
  - Status: ✅ Tested ualink_dpmem_tb and ualink_turbo64_tb successfully

  - Test with a failing simulation log (if available)
  - Status: ✅ Tested with both passing and failing logs

- [x] **Step 4.3:** Run all testbenches locally
  ```bash
  ./scripts/run_all_tests.sh
  ```
  - Status: ✅ All 3 tests passing (100% success rate)

- [x] **Step 4.4:** Fix any issues discovered during local testing
  - Status: ✅ Fixed ualink_turbo64_tb completion message

---

### Phase 5: Documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Testbenches Coverage (Phase 1)
| Testbench | What It Tests | Priority | Status |
|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| ualink_turbo64_tb | Main arbitration & packet processing | HIGH | ✅ PASSING |
| ualink_turbordwr_tb | Memory read/write operations | HIGH | ✅ PASSING |
| ualink_dpmem_tb | Dual-port RAM functionality | MEDIUM | ✅ PASSING |

**Note:** Three additional testbenches (ualink_mac_tb, nf10_bram_output_queues_tb, nf10_nic_output_port_lookup_tb) were removed from CI per project lead's direction.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 3 testbenches compile without errors
- ✅ All simulations complete without timeout
- ✅ No ERROR or FAIL messages in logs
- ✅ Simulations reach $finish statement
- ✅ Total CI runtime < 5 minutes (currently ~45 seconds)
- ✅ Waveforms captured on failures
- ✅ 100% test pass rate achieved

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Script Permission Denied
**Solution:** Make scripts executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/*.py
```

### Issue: Icarus Verilog Not Found in CI
**Solution:** Verify installation step in workflow
```yaml
- name: Install Icarus Verilog
  run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y iverilog
```

### Issue: File Not Found During Compilation
**Solution:** Check that `cd` command in run_test.sh navigates to correct directory

### Issue: Test Passes Locally but Fails in CI
**Solution:**
- Check file paths (case sensitivity on Linux)
- Verify all dependencies are listed in SOURCES
- Check for hardcoded absolute paths

### Issue: Simulation Timeout
**Solution:** Adjust timeout in testbench or add timeout parameter to vvp command

---

## Phase 8: Enhanced Developer Experience (Phase 2)

### Overview
Phase 2 focuses on improving the developer experience with rich PR feedback, smart optimizations, and automated performance tracking. Estimated time: 17.5-28.5 hours (2-3 weeks).

---

### Step 8.1: PR Status Reporting (Section 7.5)
- [ ] **Create `scripts/generate_pr_summary.py`**
  - Purpose: Generate rich markdown summary of test results
  - Inputs: All test logs
  - Output: Formatted markdown with pass/fail stats, timing, links to artifacts

- [ ] **Create `scripts/aggregate_test_results.py`**
  - Purpose: Collect results from all parallel test jobs
  - Output: JSON summary of all test outcomes

- [ ] **Update `.github/workflows/regression.yml`**
  - Add aggregation job that runs after all tests
  - Post summary as PR comment using `actions/github-script@v6`
  - Example output:
    ```
    ## 🧪 Verilog Regression Test Results

    ✅ **3/3 tests passed** (100% success rate)
    ⏱️ Total time: 45 seconds

    | Test | Status | Time |
    |------|--------|------|
    | ualink_turbo64_tb | ✅ Pass | 15s |
    | ualink_turbordwr_tb | ✅ Pass | 18s |
    | ualink_dpmem_tb | ✅ Pass | 12s |
    ```

---

### Step 8.2: CI Badge (Section 7.5.5)
- [ ] **Add badge to README.md**
  ```markdown
  ![CI Status](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/PortAlchemy/workflows/Verilog%20Regression%20Tests/badge.svg)
  ```
  - Automatically updates with CI status
  - Shows green (passing) or red (failing)
  - Links to latest workflow run

---

### Step 8.3: Smart Test Selection (Section 6.2.4)
- [ ] **Create path-based test filtering**
  - Only run tests affected by changed files
  - Detect changed files: `git diff --name-only ${{ github.base_ref }}...${{ github.sha }}`
  - Map files to testbenches:
    ```yaml
    - name: Detect changed files
      id: changes
      run: |
        if [[ "$CHANGED_FILES" =~ "ualink_turbo64" ]]; then
          echo "run_turbo64=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        fi
    ```
  - Expected improvement: 60%+ CI time reduction for focused changes

---

### Step 8.4: Security Enhancements (Section 3.4)
- [ ] **Pin action versions with SHA**
  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744  # v3.6.0
  ```

- [ ] **Configure minimal permissions**
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write  # For PR comments
  ```

- [ ] **Add secrets scanning** (if needed)
  - Use `truffleHog` or similar to scan for leaked credentials

- [ ] **Enable dependency review**
  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v3
  ```

---

### Step 8.5: Performance Baselines (Section 7.4.7)
- [ ] **Establish baseline metrics**
  - Run each test 3 times, record average duration
  - Store in `performance_baselines.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "ualink_turbo64_tb": {"avg_time_ms": 15000, "threshold_ms": 22500},
      "ualink_turbordwr_tb": {"avg_time_ms": 18000, "threshold_ms": 27000}
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Create `scripts/check_performance_regression.py`**
  - Compare current run time to baseline
  - Fail if test takes >1.5x baseline (50% slowdown)
  - Generate performance report in PR comment

---

### Step 8.6: Failure Categorization (Section 7.4.9)
- [ ] **Create `scripts/categorize_failure.py`**
  - Analyze failure logs to determine root cause
  - Categories:
    - Compilation error (syntax, missing files)
    - Assertion failure (functional bug)
    - Timeout (infinite loop, performance issue)
    - Environment issue (tool version, missing dependency)

- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guidance**
  - Each category provides specific next steps
  - Example: "Compilation error → Check line 45 in ualink_turbo64.v"

---

### Step 8.7: Enhanced Error Patterns (Section 7.4.4)
- [ ] **Update `parse_results.py` with more patterns**
  - Add simulation-specific error messages
  - Add Icarus Verilog warning patterns
  - Add assertion failure patterns from testbenches

---

### Step 8.8: Environment Validation (Section 7.4.5)
- [ ] **Add pre-test validation step**
  ```yaml
  - name: Validate environment
    run: |
      iverilog -v | grep -q "11.0" || exit 1
      python3 --version | grep -q "3.1" || exit 1
  ```

---

## Phase 3 Implementation Strategy

1. **Monitor Phase 2 for 4-6 weeks**
   - Collect data on failure types
   - Track debugging time
   - Survey team for pain points

2. **Prioritize based on impact**
   - Which features save the most time?
   - Which address the most frequent issues?
   - What's required by external factors (certification, etc.)?

3. **Implement incrementally**
   - One feature at a time
   - Validate each before moving to next
   - Measure ROI (time saved vs time invested)

**Total Phase 3 Time:** Variable (55-98 hours for all features, but implement selectively)
