Dual Port RAM Testbench Started
========================================

Test 1: Port A Write and Read
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x10, Data=0xdeadbeefcafebabe
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time                36000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time                46000
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x10, Data=0xdeadbeefcafebabe

Test 2: Port B operations (Note: Port B write is commented out in module)
  [Port B Write] Addr=0x20, Data=0x123456789abcdef0
  [Port B Read]  Addr=0x20, Data=0x123456789abcdef0

Test 3: Multiple writes to Port A
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x00, Data=0x0000000000000001
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               156000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               166000
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x01, Data=0x0000000000000002
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x02, Data=0x0000000000000004
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               196000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               206000
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x03, Data=0x0000000000000008

Test 4: Sequential reads from Port A
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x00, Data=0x0000000000000001
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x01, Data=0x0000000000000002
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x02, Data=0x0000000000000004
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x03, Data=0x0000000000000008

Test 5: Write-first behavior (should see BEEFbeef on write)
  [Port A Write] Addr=0x50, Data=0xaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               356000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               366000
  dout_a after write = 0xaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb (expected BEEFbeef)
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0x50, Data=0xaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb
  dout_a after read = 0xaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb (expected AAAAAAAA_BBBBBBBB)

Test 6: Simultaneous Port A and Port B access (different addresses)
  [Port A Write] Addr=0xa0, Data=0x1111111111111111
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               416000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               426000
  [Port B Read]  Addr=0x10, Data=0xdeadbeefcafebabe

Test 7: Same address access from both ports
  [Port A Write] Addr=0xff, Data=0xffffffffffffffff
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               456000
  WARNING: Write-first behavior violation at time               466000
  [Port B Read]  Addr=0xff, Data=0xffffffffffffffff
  [Port A Read]  Addr=0xff, Data=0xffffffffffffffff
